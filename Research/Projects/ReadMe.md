## Abstract Syntax Notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1 (1984)

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is an interface description language (IDL) for defining data structures that can be serialized and deserialized in a cross-platform way.

While ASN.1 is an attempt at generalizing data description via IDLs, a subset of encodings can encode a subset of binary data structures.

## Simple Binary Encoding

https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding (2013)

Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) is an OSI layer 6 presentation for encoding and decoding binary application messages for low-latency financial applications.

SBE is a one-to-many approach using an Interface Design Language in XML and a source generation tool for several languages for message based binary protocols.

## Kaitai Struct

A one-to-many approach using an Interface Design Language (.ksy) and a source generation tool for several languages for arbitrary binary protocols.
