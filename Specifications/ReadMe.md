## Omi Protocol Reference

This repository organizes protocol specifications into a standardized library.  

All documentation in this directory has been collected from publicly available sources.  Additionally, these documents preserve the historical record as organizations often remove inactive protocols.  If any information is in violation of copyright, please communicate through official channels and The Open Markets Initiative will remove it.
