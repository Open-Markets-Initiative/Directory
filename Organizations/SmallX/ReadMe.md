## The Small Exchange

The Small ExchangeÂ® is making futures markets more accessible to more people. Futures are more capital-efficient than stocks, but their complex design and large size have kept modern traders from adopting them for speculative and risk management needs. The Smalls offer the best of both worlds with products that are small, standard, and simple.
