## Itch (Protocol)

Proprietary Binary Protocol developed by Nasadaq and licensed to many exchanges around the world.
  
ITCH is a direct data-feed protocol such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol). ITCH makes it possible for subscribers to track the status of each order from the time it is first entered until the time it is either executed or canceled. Subscribers can also disseminate or receive administrative messages. ITCH is intended for information exchange only.
