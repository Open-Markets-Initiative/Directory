## Document Copyright

All documents and images have been collected from publicly available sources.  If copyright owners would like any materials removed from this directory please let us know.

## Generated Source Copyright

Machine generated Omi code has a provable origin, however, we recognize that some 'models' might be considered proprietary technology.  If copyright owners would like any generated sources removed from github please let us know.  We reserve the right to compare our sources to a dated source-controlled sample.

## Copyrighted Source Generation Technology

Rights to modular protocol code generation technologies remain with Omi.  Each model is 'quarantined' as a separate platform plugin project.  Legally this restricts any copyright leakage across models.
