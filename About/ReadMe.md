## The Open Markets Initiative

[The Open Markets Initiative](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/Directory/tree/master/About "About Omi") (Omi) is an organization dedicated to enhancing the stability of electronic financial markets using modern development methods.

## Omi Philosophy

The Open Markets Initiative is officially market neutral.  We believe the best results will be achieved through competition.  Furthermore, we will not take sides in any of the battles between brokers, exchanges, trading firms, technology companies or even different technologies.
However, note that we support certain polices: transparency and best practices

## Transparency

It is official policy of the OMI to publish exchange public protocol specifications and test data.

Some technology should remain private; however, most electronic trading participants would benefit from a more open world.  For example, we believe some, if not all, public exchanges should publish most of their tech stack, including specifications, hardware and matching engines.  

## Best practices

Source code should use:
- Automated build processes
- Regression testing
- Clean code and SOLID principles

Source generated repositories are a testing ground for code generation technologies which are under patent review.

Enjoy.
