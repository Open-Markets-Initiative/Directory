## The Open Markets Initiative

The Open Markets Initiative (Omi) is a group of technologists dedicated to enhancing the stability of electronic financial markets using modern development methods.

Source code should use best practices:
- Automated build processes
- Regression testing
- Clean code and SOLID principles

Source generated repositories are a testing ground for code generation technologies which are under patent review.

Enjoy.
