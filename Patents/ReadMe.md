# Patents

A series of patents and open source projects have been created in the technical field of Binary Protocol Source Generation.

## Compiling protocol analysis code using protocol database

2002-06-24 to 2022-09-07 

https://patents.google.com/patent/US7401326B1/en

A one-to-many approach using a database of symbols and a source generation tool for several languages.

## Systems and methods for data coding, transmission, storage and decoding

2005-11-14 to 2030-05-27 (Farber)

https://patents.google.com/patent/US8321465B2/en

A one-to-many approach using an Interface Design Language and a source generation tool for several languages in a subset of binary protocols.

## Universal binary specification model

2024-09-24 to 2042-10-13 (Tegel)

https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240129382A1/en

The first in a series of patents using a many-to-many approach that can take any IDL or binary protocol documentation using an independent intermediate representation for common operations within a multistage binary data model compiler. 

IDLs and the existing source generation tools used reduce the efficacy of the source generation platform.

# Open Source Projects

## Kaitia Struct

https://kaitai.io

Kaitai Struct is a domain-specific language (DSL) that is designed with one particular task in mind: dealing with arbitrary binary formats.

A one-to-many approach using an Interface Design Language and a source generation tool for several languages for arbitrary binary protocols.

Due to differences in the IDL and scope of source generation cases, the Open Markets Initiative believes that Kaitai Struct does not infringe on any existing patents.

## Simple Binary Encoding

https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding

Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) is an OSI layer 6 presentation for encoding and decoding binary application messages for low-latency financial applications.

SBE is a one-to-many approach using an Interface Design Language in XML and a source generation tool for several languages for arbitrary binary protocols.

The intellectual property disclosed in Farber bares striking resemblance to SBE.
